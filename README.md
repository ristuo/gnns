# gnns
Implementation of GNNS algorithms of Hajebi et al (2011)

Installation and running:

data is assumed to reside in data folder in project root as row oriented csv matrix. File paths to data files should be set in main.cpp.

```
cd to project root
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
./graph
```

if your terminal does not support colors output may appear weird at times.
